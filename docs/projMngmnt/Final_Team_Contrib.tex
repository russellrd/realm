\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Those not able to make the lecture caught up by reading the slides.

\section{TA Document Discussion Attendance}

\section{Commits}

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lll}
\toprule
\textbf{Student} & \textbf{Commits} & \textbf{Percent}\\

At the time of writing this productivity report, many team members are still working on their features and those haven't been committed/pushed yet. The numbers may be skewed and not an entirely accurate representation of the team's productivity. Rafey was responsible for fixing a lot of the issues in our documents and has smaller sized commits, which is why he has a higher count. Whereas the others may have done larger, but fewer commits.\\

Additional commits: Avanish had 2 extra commits from other branches not yet merged into main.

\section{Issue Tracker}

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lll}
\toprule
\textbf{Student} & \textbf{Authored (O+C)} & \textbf{Assigned (C only)}\\
\midrule
Avanish Ahluwalia & 0 & 0\\
Russell Davidson & 0 & 0\\
Rafey Malik & 3 & 0\\
Abdul Zulfiqar & 0 & 0\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

We didn't have many issues, as they were only for team meetings and lectures. The work was assigned informally, therefore no assigned issues.
