\section{Introduction}

Hazard Analysis is a key step in the engineering process, which is used to identify potential risks and dangers in a system or process. It helps us to ensure the safety and risk management of a system. By systematically analyzing potential risks of the system, we can work to mitigate these potential harms and any consequences that may arise. This document is a key part of the overall safety of the Realm app. It aims to help our stakeholders understand the possible risks of the app and all precautions we have in place to prevent such risks.

\section{Scope and Purpose of Hazard Analysis}

The scope of this Hazard Analysis covers the identification, evaluation, and mitigation of hazards as it relates to the entire development process of the Realm project. Hazards which are considered in this document include features within the app, and external hazards through the environment.\\

Certain losses that could be incurred because of hazards are loss of privacy, including unauthorized tracking of users location and unauthorized sharing of personal data, such as email or password. Another loss is health risks from bright flashes within the app, which can trigger seizures in users that may be suffering from photosensitive epilepsy. Furthermore, human injury may occur from accidents because of users being distracted from AR content.

\section{System Boundaries and Components}

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{sys_bound_comp.png} \\
    \textbf{Figure 1: System Boundaries and Components}
\end{center}

There are two types of sub-systems that make up the project:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Internal}: These are sub-systems that are designed and implemented by us for this project.
    \item \emph{External}: These are sub-systems that are created by a third-party.
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{\arabic*.}]
    \item \textbf{Realm App}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Realm Interface / Sub-Realms
        \item Tours
    \end{enumerate}
    \textbf{On Failure:} \emph{See \ref{ssub:fmea}}
    \item \textbf{Cloud}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Accounts
        \item Synced Object Data
    \end{enumerate}
    \textbf{On Failure:} \emph{See \ref{ssub:fmea}}
    \item \textbf{External Libraries}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Maps
        \item AR
        \item Authentication
    \end{enumerate}
    \textbf{On Failure:} A message will be displayed to inform the user that the app can't connect to a specific service.
    \item \textbf{Hardware}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Android Devices
        \item iOS Devices
    \end{enumerate}
    \textbf{On Failure:} The user will get information from the hardware device itself.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Critical Assumptions}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The software system is only used in the intended software environments (unmodified iOS and Android Versions 16.0+ and 12.0+ respectively as per distribution requirement DI-D1)
    \item The software system is only used on devices that meet the minimum hardware requirements (GPS, camera, and all required sensors present)
    \item The user device hardware will not fail for reasons unrelated to the software system
\end{itemize}
