\section{Introduction}

Hazard Analysis is a key step in the engineering process, which is used to identify potential risks and dangers in a system or process. It helps us to ensure the safety and risk management of a system. By systematically analyzing potential risks of the system, we can work to mitigate these potential harms and any consequences that may arise. This document is a key part of the overall safety of the Realm app. It aims to help our stakeholders understand the possible risks of the app and all precautions we have in place to prevent such risks.

\section{Scope and Purpose of Hazard Analysis}

The scope of this Hazard Analysis covers the identification, evaluation, and mitigation of hazards as it relates to the entire development process of the Realm project. Hazards which are considered in this document include features within the app, and external hazards through the environment.\\

Certain losses that could be incurred because of hazards are loss of privacy, including unauthorized tracking of users location and unauthorized sharing of personal data, such as email or password. Another loss is health risks from bright flashes within the app, which can trigger seizures in users that may be suffering from photosensitive epilepsy. Furthermore, human injury may occur from accidents because of users being distracted from AR content.

\section{System Boundaries and Components}

\wss{Dividing the system into components will help you brainstorm the hazards.
You shouldn't do a full design of the components, just get a feel for the major
ones.  For projects that involve hardware, the components will typically include
each individual piece of hardware.  If your software will have a database, or an
important library, these are also potential components.}

\section{Critical Assumptions}

\wss{These assumptions that are made about the software or system.  You should
minimize the number of assumptions that remove potential hazards.  For instance,
you could assume a part will never fail, but it is generally better to include
this potential failure mode.}

\section{Failure Mode and Effect Analysis}

\wss{Include your FMEA table here. This is the most important part of this document.}
\wss{The safety requirements in the table do not have to have the prefix SR.
The most important thing is to show traceability to your SRS. You might trace to
requirements you have already written, or you might need to add new
requirements.}
\wss{If no safety requirement can be devised, other mitigation strategies can be
entered in the table, including strategies involving providing additional
documentation, and/or test cases.}

\section{Safety and Security Requirements}

\wss{Newly discovered requirements.  These should also be added to the SRS.  (A rationale design process how and why to fake it.)}

\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{SR-\arabic*},ref=SR-\arabic*]
    \item \label{SR-1} The system shall include a flow meter to measure insulin output flow.
    \item \label{SR-2} The system shall have an infusion delivery control mechanism.
    \item \label{SR-3} The system shall detect incorrect basal or bolus bounds settings.
    \item \label{SR-4} The system shall notify the user when insulin levels are low.
\end{enumerate}

% Example of referencing the requirements
In this analysis, we focus on requirement \ref{SR-1} and \ref{SR-2}, which are critical for ensuring proper insulin delivery. Additionally, \ref{SR-3} helps mitigate failure due to incorrect settings.

\section{Roadmap}

Which requirements will be implemented in the future?}
