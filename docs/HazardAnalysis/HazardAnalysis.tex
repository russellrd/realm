\section{Introduction}

Hazard Analysis is a key step in the engineering process, which is used to identify potential risks and dangers in a system or process. It helps us to ensure the safety and risk management of a system. By systematically analyzing potential risks of the system, we can work to mitigate these potential harms and any consequences that may arise. This document is a key part of the overall safety of the Realm app. It aims to help our stakeholders understand the possible risks of the app and all precautions we have in place to prevent such risks.

\section{Scope and Purpose of Hazard Analysis}

The scope of this Hazard Analysis covers the identification, evaluation, and mitigation of hazards as it relates to the entire development process of the Realm project. Hazards which are considered in this document include features within the app, and external hazards through the environment.\\

Certain losses that could be incurred because of hazards are loss of privacy, including unauthorized tracking of users location and unauthorized sharing of personal data, such as email or password. Another loss is health risks from bright flashes within the app, which can trigger seizures in users that may be suffering from photosensitive epilepsy. Furthermore, human injury may occur from accidents because of users being distracted from AR content.

\section{System Boundaries and Components}

\wss{Dividing the system into components will help you brainstorm the hazards.
You shouldn't do a full design of the components, just get a feel for the major
ones.  For projects that involve hardware, the components will typically include
each individual piece of hardware.  If your software will have a database, or an
important library, these are also potential components.}

\section{Critical Assumptions}

\wss{These assumptions that are made about the software or system.  You should
minimize the number of assumptions that remove potential hazards.  For instance,
you could assume a part will never fail, but it is generally better to include
this potential failure mode.}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The software system is only used in the intended software environments (unmodified iOS and Android Versions 16.0+ and 12.0+ respectively as per distribution requirement DI-D1)
    \item The software system is only used on devices that meet the minimum hardware requirements (GPS, camera, and all required sensors present)
\end{itemize}

\section{Failure Mode and Effect Analysis}

\wss{Include your FMEA table here. This is the most important part of this document.}
\wss{The safety requirements in the table do not have to have the prefix SR.
The most important thing is to show traceability to your SRS. You might trace to
requirements you have already written, or you might need to add new
requirements.}
\wss{If no safety requirement can be devised, other mitigation strategies can be
entered in the table, including strategies involving providing additional
documentation, and/or test cases.}

\subsection{Hazards Out of Scope}

Hazards resulting from the failure of the following components will not be considered in this analysis as the software system cannot mitigate hazards in these external systems 
\begin{itemize}
    \item User device hardware
    \item Back-end server hardware
\end{itemize}

\section{Safety and Security Requirements}

\wss{Newly discovered requirements.  These should also be added to the SRS.  (A rationale design process how and why to fake it.)}

\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{SR-\arabic*},ref=SR-\arabic*]
    \item \label{SR-5} The system shall implement encryption protocols to protect user data when storing.
    \item \label{SR-6} The system shall provide a multi-factor authentication option for user accounts to enhance security.
    \item \label{SR-7} The system shall provide fallback modes for rendering AR objects on low-performance devices to ensure accessibility for all users.
    \item \label{SR-8} The system shall allow users to customize rendering settings (e.g., brightness, effects) to minimize discomfort or health risks associated with viewing objects.
    \item \label{SR-9} The system shall display indicators to alert users when rendering might cause discomfort (e.g., rapid movement or flashing effects).

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Robustness Requirements}

\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{RR-\arabic*},ref=SR-\arabic*]
    \item \label{RR-1} The system must have an automated mechanism to retry the upload and storage of object instances when an initial attempt fails
    \item \label{RR-2} All internal APIs of the system must provide useful error messages in the case of system failures
    \item \label{RR-3} The system must automatically back up databases daily
    \item \label{RR-4} The system must have a mechanism to restore a database from a backup in the case of unrecoverable failure / corruption
\end{enumerate}

Which requirements will be implemented in the future?}
