\section{Introduction}

Hazard Analysis is a key step in the engineering process, which is used to identify potential risks and dangers in a system or process. It helps us to ensure the safety and risk management of a system. By systematically analyzing potential risks of the system, we can work to mitigate these potential harms and any consequences that may arise. This document is a key part of the overall safety of the Realm app. It aims to help our stakeholders understand the possible risks of the app and all precautions we have in place to prevent such risks.

\section{Scope and Purpose of Hazard Analysis}

The scope of this Hazard Analysis covers the identification, evaluation, and mitigation of hazards as it relates to the entire development process of the Realm project. A hazard is defined as a property or condition in the system, which when combined with a condition in the environment, has the potential to cause harm or damage. Hazards which are considered in this document include features within the app, and external hazards through the environment. The purpose of hazard analysis is to identify potential hazards in a system early in the design process to mitigate risks and ensure the safety and reliability of the system. \\

Certain losses that could be incurred because of hazards are loss of privacy, including unauthorized tracking of users location and unauthorized sharing of personal data, such as email or password. Another loss is health risks from bright flashes within the app, which can trigger seizures in users that may be suffering from photosensitive epilepsy. Furthermore, human injury may occur from accidents because of users being distracted from AR content.

\section{System Boundaries and Components}

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{sys_bound_comp.png} \\
    \textbf{Figure 1: System Boundaries and Components}
\end{center}

There are two types of sub-systems that make up the project:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Internal}: These are sub-systems that are designed and implemented as part of the project.
    \item \emph{External}: These are sub-systems that are created by a third-party.
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{\arabic*.}]
    \item \textbf{Realm App}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Realm Interface
        \item Tours
    \end{enumerate}
    \textbf{On Failure:} \emph{See \nameref{sub:fmea}}
    \item \textbf{Cloud}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Accounts
        \item Synced Object Data
    \end{enumerate}
    \textbf{On Failure:} \emph{See \nameref{sub:fmea}}
    \item \textbf{External Libraries}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Maps
        \item AR
        \item Weather
        \item Authentication
    \end{enumerate}
    \textbf{On Failure:} A message will be displayed to inform the user that the app can't connect to a specific service.
    \item \textbf{Hardware}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Android Devices
        \item iOS Devices
    \end{enumerate}
    \textbf{On Failure:} The user will get information from the hardware device itself.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Critical Assumptions}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The software system is only used in the intended software environments (unmodified iOS and Android Versions 16.0+ and 12.0+ respectively as per distribution requirement DI-D1)
    \item The software system is only used on devices that meet the minimum hardware requirements (GPS, camera, and all required sensors present)
    \item The user device hardware will not fail for reasons unrelated to the software system
\end{itemize}

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

\input{../Reflection.tex}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item What went well while writing this deliverable? \\ \\
    \hspace*{-0.97cm}\textbf{Ans.} Our time management during this deliverable was much better. We decided on much stricter deadlines that were well in advance of the deliverable's deadline, and stuck to them. This allowed us to get most of our main points done 5 days before the deadline. Additionally, we used overleaf and wrote all of our answers in latex, as opposed to writing everything in a Google document and copying it into latex afterwards as we had done for the previous deliverable. This saved us a lot of time and headache by not needing to convert our written text into latex.  \\

    \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how did you resolve them? \\ \\
    \hspace*{-0.97cm}\textbf{Ans.} When we transferred over to overleaf, we were not able to all work on one combined document and share it with each group member, because this requires access to an overleaf subscription. Instead, we had to create a separate overleaf document for each group member, add our modifications in individually, and then commit them to github via a pull request. This made it much more difficult to see what the final version of the doc would look like before merging everything in github. \\

    \item Which of your listed risks had your team thought of before this
    deliverable, and which did you think of while doing this deliverable? For
    the latter ones (ones you thought of while doing the Hazard Analysis), how did they come about? \\ \\
    \hspace*{-0.97cm}\textbf{Ans.} Some hazards we thought of before this deliverable are moderating obscene content and spamming. Hazards we came up with during this deliverable include tripping and collision, weather hazards, and the user going into restricted areas and private properties. The latter hazards came about while brainstorming, with a focus on more physical, external hazards. This was suggested by our TA, Chris, during our meeting with him. He advised us to include such hazards because our app has some physical component to it, which is that the user goes outside to use the AR features, whereas many software engineering capstone projects do not. \\

    \item Other than the risk of physical harm (some projects may not have any appreciable risks of this form), list at least 2 other types of risk in software products. Why are they important to consider? \\ \\
    \hspace*{-0.97cm}\textbf{Ans.} Security and cultural/psychological hazards. Security hazards are important to consider so that we can protect the data of the user. Our app has access to users' location data, and a data leak can be very harmful to the user, which is why security is very important. Cultural and psychological hazards are important to consider to protect the emotional and social well-being of our users. If this hazard is present, it may discourage the user from using our app, and, depending on the severity of our hazard, may result in legal trouble for the Realm app.\\
