\section{Product Overview}

\subsection{Product Perspective}

Realm, as specified in this SRS document, is a self-contained product designed to provide users with an immersive social, educational, and entertainment experience with the help of AR. This product is not part of an existing product family and does not replace any current systems. Instead, it is developed as a standalone system that allows users to create, interact with, and share virtual objects, such as 2D stickers and 3D artifacts, in real-world environments.\\

The app operates independently but may collaborate with third-party content providers, such as educational institutions or businesses, to offer //customized AR experiences. If needed, Realm could integrate with larger systems in the future, such as educational platforms or entertainment networks, by establishing appropriate interfaces for data sharing and interaction.\\

The app is to be compatible with most smartphone devices, as long as they have a camera.
