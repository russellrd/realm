        \textbf{Success Postcondition:} An \ref{def:ar_obj} report is resolved (\ref{def:ar_obj} is kept or removed)

    \item \label{uc:27}  Act on reported \ref{def:ar_obj} \\
        \textbf{Actor}: \ref{def:admin} \\
        \textbf{Pre-condition:} Admin is logged into the app \textbf{AND} Admin has navigated to the \textbf{Admin Interface} \\
    
        \textbf{Main Success Scenario:}
        \begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{\arabic*.}]
            \item Admin navigates to the “Organization User Requests” panel (\hyperref[ssub:admin_interface]{AI-FR2.2})
            \item System shows a list of \ref{def:org_user} requests
            \item Admin selects a request
            \item System gives more details about a request
            \item System also provides decision options on whether to accept or decline a request
            \item Admin reviews information and approves the request
            \item System activates the user as one of the \ref{def:org_user}
            \item System notifies the user that their request has been approved
            \item System removes organization user request
            \item System brings admin back to “Organization User Requests” panel
        \end{enumerate}
    
        \textbf{Secondary Scenarios:} 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item[{\bf 6.1:}] Admin reviews information and denies the request
            \begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{\arabic*.}]
                \item System notifies the user that their request has been denied and gives a reason why
                \item Go to step \textbf{9}
            \end{enumerate}
        \end{itemize}
        \textbf{Success Postcondition:} An \ref{def:org_user} account request is resolved (approved or denied).

\subsection{Compliance}
\label{sub:compliance}


\begin{enumerate}[align=left, label=\textbf{CO\arabic*.}]
    \item The project shall comply with the \emph{Personal Information and Electronic Documents Act} (PIPEDA).\\
    {\bf Rationale:} The Government of Canada requires all companies to follow certain rules regarding the collection, use, and dissemination of personal user information \cite{PIPEDA}.
    \item The project shall keep records of all in-app purchases and ad revenue for the purposes of yearly tax filing for the period of six years.\\
    {\bf Rationale:} Corporate taxes must be filed every year and both streams of app income will need to be reported. Businesses must keep records going back six years in the event of an audit \cite{6Year}.
    \item The app shall comply with the \emph{Google Play} developer policy.\\
    {\bf Rationale:} All apps published through \emph{Google Play} must first be reviewed by Google for compliance with the developer policy published on their website \cite{GooglePlay}.
    \item The app shall comply with \emph{App Store} review guidelines.\\
    {\bf Rationale:} For an app to be approved for dissemination on the \emph{App Store}, the app must be reviewed and approved by Apple in accordance with the acceptance criteria published on their website \cite{AppStore}.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Design and Implementation}

\subsubsection{Installation}
\label{ssub:installation}


\begin{enumerate}[align=left, label=\textbf{DI-I\arabic*.}]
    \item The app shall be installable on \emph{Android} and \emph{iOS} devices from their respective app stores.\\
    {\bf Rationale:} Users are accustomed to downloading their apps from their device app store and should not be required to navigate to a 3rd party app store. They also should not have to change OS settings in order to download the app.
    \item The app shall not require any additional installation steps beyond those required from within the target device app store.\\
    {\bf Rationale:} Users may be dissuaded from downloading the app if the installation process is too cumbersome compared to other apps.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Distribution}
\label{ssub:distribution}


\begin{enumerate}[align=left, label=\textbf{DI-D\arabic*.}]
    \item The app shall be distributed on any mobile devices running iOS 16.0+ or Android 12+\\
    {\bf Rationale:} The app should be available to as many people as possible while at the same time making the development easier by not having to keep old operating system versions supported. Versions should be supported for at least a couple years.
    \item The app shall be available in Canada and the USA.\\
    {\bf Rationale:} Due to legal considerations in different countries, the focus for this app should be the country this project is based out of, Canada, and the USA since they have a larger population with similar laws.
    \item The app shall have a recommended age requirement of 16+.\\
    {\bf Rationale:} Users may be exposed to content not suitable for really young kids so an age requirement should be recommended.
    \item The system shall store all user data within North America.\\
    {\bf Rationale:} Data should be located in a jurisdiction close to home and in a reputable country to reduce privacy concerns of foreign state actors viewing user data.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Maintainability}


\subsubsection{Reusability}

\subsubsection{Portability}
\label{ssub:portability}


\begin{enumerate}[align=left, label=\textbf{DI-P\arabic*.}]
    \item The app shall be developed using a cross-platform mobile platform that can build iOS and Android applications\\
    {\bf Rationale:} To reach as many potential users as possible, the app should be available on the two major mobile operating systems.
    \item The app shall have a common codebase that only differs in configuration files for different target operating systems.\\
    {\bf Rationale:} For ease of development on the different mobile operating systems, there should be no extra consideration for the differences between native app implementations that are not handled by the cross-platform framework.
