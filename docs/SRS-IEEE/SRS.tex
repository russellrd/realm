\subsection{Document Overview}

\wss{Describe what the rest of the document contains and how it is organized.}

\section{Product Overview}

\wss{This section should describe the general factors that affect the product and its requirements. This section does not state specific requirements. Instead, it provides a background for those requirements, which are defined in detail in Section 3, and makes them easier to understand.}
\subsection{Product Perspective}

\wss{Describe the context and origin of the product being specified in this SRS. For example, state whether this product is a follow-on member of a product family, a replacement for certain existing systems, or a new, self-contained product. If the SRS defines a component of a larger system, relate the requirements of the larger system to the functionality of this software and identify interfaces between the two. A simple diagram that shows the major components of the overall system, subsystem interconnections, and external interfaces can be helpful.}

\subsection{Product Functions}

\wss{Summarize the major functions the product must perform or must let the user perform. Details will be provided in Section 3, so only a high level summary (such as a bullet list) is needed here. Organize the functions to make them understandable to any reader of the SRS. A picture of the major groups of related requirements and how they relate, such as a top level data flow diagram or object class diagram, is often effective.}

\subsection{Product Constraints}
\wss{
    This subsection should provide a general description of any other items that will limit the developer's options. These may include:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Interfaces to users, other applications or hardware.
        \item Quality of service constraints.
        \item Standards compliance.
        \item Constraints around design or implementation.
    \end{itemize}
}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Interfaces to Users}: The platform must be compatible with both Android and iOS devices, meaning the design must accommodate different screen sizes and operating system guidelines. Additionally, the app requires user-friendly interfaces for interacting with AR objects and managing sub-realms.

    \item \textbf{Hardware Constraints}: The app depends on mobile devices with AR capabilities (e.g., cameras, GPS, accelerometers). Users with older or less powerful devices might experience limited functionality or performance issues.

    \item \textbf{Quality of Service}: Realm needs to have a smooth interaction, with little to no lag. It must also handle multiple users within a shared AR space (sub-realm).

    \item \textbf{Standards Compliance}: The app has to comply with relevant privacy laws and app store requirements for both Android and iOS.

    \item \textbf{Design and Implementation Constraints}: The app needs to provide cloud storage for AR objects and user data, and its design should allow for easy scalability as the user base grows. Additionally, the AR features and general app use should be intuitive and easy to use for users.

    \item \textbf{Budget Constraints}: The project has a maximum budget of \$750.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{User Characteristics}

\wss{Identify the various user classes that you anticipate will use this product. User classes may be differentiated based on frequency of use, subset of product functions used, technical expertise, security or privilege levels, educational level, or experience. Describe the pertinent characteristics of each user class. Certain requirements may pertain only to certain user classes. Distinguish the most important user classes for this product from those who are less important to satisfy.}

\subsection{Assumptions and Dependencies}

\wss{List any assumed factors (as opposed to known facts) that could affect the requirements stated in the SRS. These could include third-party or commercial components that you plan to use, issues around the development or operating environment, or constraints. The project could be affected if these assumptions are incorrect, are not shared, or change. Also identify any dependencies the project has on external factors, such as software components that you intend to reuse from another project, unless they are already documented elsewhere (for example, in the vision and scope document or the project plan).}

\begin{itemize}
    \item User has used a mobile app before
    \item User has internet access
    \item User device can provide GPS location services
    \item User device has a camera
    \item User device utilizes either Android or IOS operating systems
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Apportioning of Requirements}

\wss{Apportion the software requirements to software elements. For requirements that will require implementation over multiple software elements, or when allocation to a software element is initially undefined, this should be so stated. A cross reference table by function and software element should be used to summarize the apportioning.\\}

\wss{Identify requirements that may be delayed until future versions of the system (e.g., blocks and/or increments).}

        \item Optionally state the conditions and constraints, if any.
        \item Describe every input (stimulus) into the software system, every output (response) from the software system, and all functions performed by the software system in response to an input or in support of an output.
        \item Be verifiable (e.g., the requirement realization can be proven to the customer's satisfaction)
        \item Conform to agreed upon syntax, keywords, and terms.
    \end{itemize}
}

\subsection{External Interfaces}
\wss{

\label{sub:compliance}

\wss{Specify the requirements derived from existing standards or regulations, including:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Report format
        \item Data naming
        \item Accounting procedures
        \item Audit tracing
    \end{itemize}
}

\wss{For example, this could specify the requirement for software to trace processing activity. Such traces are needed for some applications to meet minimum regulatory or financial standards. An audit trace requirement may, for example, state that all changes to a payroll database shall be recorded in a trace file with before and after values.}

\begin{enumerate}[align=left, label=\textbf{CO\arabic*.}]
    \item The project shall comply with the \emph{Personal Information and Electronic Documents Act} (PIPEDA).\\
    {\bf Rationale:} The Government of Canada requires all companies to follow certain rules regarding the collection, use, and dissemination of personal user information \cite{PIPEDA}.
    \item The project shall keep records of all in-app purchases and ad revenue for the purposes of yearly tax filing for the period of six years.\\
    {\bf Rationale:} Corporate taxes must be filed every year and both streams of app income will need to be reported. Businesses must keep records going back six years in the event of an audit \cite{6Year}.
    \item The app shall comply with the \emph{Google Play} developer policy.\\
    {\bf Rationale:} All apps published through \emph{Google Play} must first be reviewed by Google for compliance with the developer policy published on their website \cite{GooglePlay}.
    \item The app shall comply with \emph{App Store} review guidelines.\\
    {\bf Rationale:} For an app to be approved for dissemination on the \emph{App Store}, the app must be reviewed and approved by Apple in accordance with the acceptance criteria published on their website \cite{AppStore}.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Design and Implementation}

\subsubsection{Installation}
\label{ssub:installation}

\wss{Constraints to ensure that the software-to-be will run smoothly on the target implementation platform.}

\begin{enumerate}[align=left, label=\textbf{DI-I\arabic*.}]
    \item The app shall be installable on \emph{Android} and \emph{iOS} devices from their respective app stores.\\
    {\bf Rationale:} Users are accustomed to downloading their apps from their device app store and should not be required to navigate to a 3rd party app store. They also should not have to change OS settings in order to download the app.
    \item The app shall not require any additional installation steps beyond those required from within the target device app store.\\
    {\bf Rationale:} Users may be dissuaded from downloading the app if the installation process is too cumbersome compared to other apps.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Distribution}
\label{ssub:distribution}

\wss{Constraints on software components to fit the geographically distributed structure of the host organization, the distribution of data to be processed, or the distribution of devices to be controlled.}

\begin{enumerate}[align=left, label=\textbf{DI-D\arabic*.}]
    \item The app shall be distributed on any mobile devices running iOS 16.0+ or Android 12+\\
    {\bf Rationale:} The app should be available to as many people as possible while at the same time making the development easier by not having to keep old operating system versions supported. Versions should be supported for at least a couple years.
    \item The app shall be available in Canada and the USA.\\
    {\bf Rationale:} Due to legal considerations in different countries, the focus for this app should be the country this project is based out of, Canada, and the USA since they have a larger population with similar laws.
    \item The app shall have a recommended age requirement of 16+.\\
    {\bf Rationale:} Users may be exposed to content not suitable for really young kids so an age requirement should be recommended.
    \item The system shall store all user data within North America.\\
    {\bf Rationale:} Data should be located in a jurisdiction close to home and in a reputable country to reduce privacy concerns of foreign state actors viewing user data.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Maintainability}

\wss{Specify attributes of software that relate to the ease of maintenance of the software itself. These may include requirements for certain modularity, interfaces, or complexity limitation. Requirements should not be placed here just because they are thought to be good design practices.}

\subsubsection{Reusability}

\subsubsection{Portability}
\label{ssub:portability}

\wss{Specify attributes of software that relate to the ease of porting the software to other host machines and/or operating systems.}

\begin{enumerate}[align=left, label=\textbf{DI-P\arabic*.}]
    \item The app shall be developed using a cross-platform mobile platform that can build iOS and Android applications\\
    {\bf Rationale:} To reach as many potential users as possible, the app should be available on the two major mobile operating systems.
    \item The app shall have a common codebase that only differs in configuration files for different target operating systems.\\
    {\bf Rationale:} For ease of development on the different mobile operating systems, there should be no extra consideration for the differences between native app implementations that are not handled by the cross-platform framework.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Cost}

\wss{Specify monetary cost of the software product.}

\subsubsection{Deadline}

\wss{Specify schedule for delivery of the software product.}

\subsubsection{Proof of Concept}
