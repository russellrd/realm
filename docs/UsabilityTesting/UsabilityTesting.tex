\section{Introduction}

To gain a better understanding of how usable the Realm app is, two usability surveys were conducted: one for Rev0 and one for Rev1. Having these done at different stages of development provides the team with a data-backed view on the success of tailoring the app based on user feedback. The results of the first survey were already published in the \textit{VnV Report}, but they will be shown again for comparison purposes. Using the most up-to-date data, future development steps will be outlined based on areas the require the most work from a user perspective.

\section{Survey}
The survey consists of six questions where participants rate on a scale of 1-5 how much they agree/disagree with a statement relating to their user experience. \\

\noindent The following statements were put forward and rated by the user on a scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree):
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Navigation between interfaces is intuitive
    \item Placing objects in edit mode is easy
    \item Generating objects through prompts is easy
    \item It is easy to start a tour
    \item The app is generally satisfying to use
    \item Using the app distracts you from your surroundings
\end{enumerate}

\section{Results}
This section will analyze the results of the usability survey completed by users who were using the app for the first time.

\subsection{Comparison}
For each answer a comparison of the results will be conducted.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textit{Navigation between interfaces is intuitive}\\
    Since Rev0, much effort was put into the app user interface flow. This seems to have translated into increased user satisfaction in Rev1 with almost everyone liking it.
    \item \textit{Placing objects in edit mode is easy}\\
    The AR object placement flow did not change much between Rev0 and Rev1 so the similar results seems to track.
    \item \textit{Generating objects through prompts is easy}\\
    With the overall app UI improvements, also came improvements to the prompt generation screen which users seem to think is easy to use in Rev1.
    \item \textit{It is easy to start a tour}\\
    The app home screen now has a list of tours a user can choose from and preview. From here, they can start the tour. It only takes two button presses, so all users found this very easy.
    \item \textit{The app is generally satisfying to use}\\
    Most people liked the app for the most part in both Rev0 and Rev1 though it seems the rating went slightly down in Rev1.
    \item \textit{Using the app distracts you from your surroundings}\\
    This statement is relatively vague so that could account from the wide spread of ratings in both Rev0 and Rev1. Rev1 users found it less distracting likely due to the hiding of AR virtual planes in tour viewing mode.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Conclusion}
Through both of the usability tests conducted, users generally liked the app, and it seems they liked it even more after the changes were made to the app UI. There were still quite a few suggestions for improvements and new features that could be made in the future. These include more visual queues when going through the object placement steps and a more robust help feature for users who want to learn more about a specific feature.
