\wss{The intention of the VnV plan is to increase confidence in the software.
However, this does not mean listing every verification and validation technique
that has ever been devised.  The VnV plan should also be a \textbf{feasible}
plan. Execution of the plan should be possible with the time and team available.
If the full plan cannot be completed during the time available, it can either be
modified to ``fake it'', or a better solution is to add a section describing
what work has been completed and what work is still planned for the future.}

\wss{The VnV plan is typically started after the requirements stage, but before
the design stage.  This means that the sections related to unit testing cannot
initially be completed.  The sections will be filled in after the design stage
is complete.  the final version of the VnV plan should have all sections filled
in.}

The purpose of this Verification and Validation (VnV) document is to outline the testing process we’ll use to make sure our project meets all its requirements and functions correctly. Verification checks that we’re building the product according to our design, while validation ensures the product meets the users’ needs and performs as expected. This document will describe both functional and non-functional tests, which help confirm that the project is reliable, safe, and easy to use. By following this VnV plan, we can identify and fix any issues early, ensuring the final product is high-quality and ready for users.

\section{General Information}

\subsection{Summary}

\wss{Say what software is being tested.  Give its name and a brief overview of
  its general functions.}

The software being tested is "Realm", an AR social platform. The platform allows users to place AR objects in the real world for others to see, and allows organizations to create AR tours to provide users high quality experiences.

\subsection{Objectives}

\wss{State what is intended to be accomplished.  The objective will be around
  the qualities that are most important for your project.  You might have
  something like: ``build confidence in the software correctness,''
  ``demonstrate adequate usability.'' etc.  You won't list all of the qualities,
  just those that are most important.}

\wss{You should also list the objectives that are out of scope.  You don't have 
the resources to do everything, so what will you be leaving out.  For instance, 
if you are not going to verify the quality of usability, state this.  It is also 
worthwhile to justify why the objectives are left out.}

\wss{The objectives are important because they highlight that you are aware of 
limitations in your resources for verification and validation.  You can't do everything, 
so what are you going to prioritize?  As an example, if your system depends on an 
external library, you can explicitly state that you will assume that external library 
has already been verified by its implementation team.}

\subsection{Challenge Level and Extras}

The challenge level for the Realm project is \textbf{general}. The extras that are going to be tackled in this project are \textbf{user documentation} and \textbf{usability testing}.

\subsection{Relevant Documentation}

This document contains information garnered from all the previous documentation referenced below:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The Problem Statement \cite{ProblemStatement} is a good reference to understand the context in which all of the requirements come from. The plans in this document should reflect the goals outlined in the Problem Statement.
    \item The Development Plan \cite{DevelopmentPlan} has a list of team member roles which are should be considered when writing about a team member's testing role.
    \item The SRS \cite{SRS} contains all of the functional (FR) and non-functional (NFR) requirements that were found in the elicitation process and those that were found after the initial version. This document strives to have a plan for each of these requirements.
    \item The HA \cite{HA} has many considerations for potential hazards and mitigation strategies to reduce the project risk. There are many new FRs and NFRs that were derived from this analysis that need to be verified and validated.
    \item The VnV Plan \cite{VnV} itself is also subject to verification as outlined by the \nameref{ssub:vnv_plan_verificaiton_plan} sub-section.

\section{Plan}
\label{sub:plan}

This section outlines the structured plan for verifying and validating our project at each stage of development. It first lists the roles of the team members involved in verification, the strategies for ensuring the accuracy of our requirements, design, and implementation, as well as the tools we'll use for automated testing. Each part is designed to ensure our project meets quality standards and fulfills its intended purpose.

\subsection{Verification and Validation Team}

\wss{Your teammates.  Maybe your supervisor.
  You should do more than list names.  You should say what each person's role is
  for the project's verification.  A table is a good way to summarize this information.}

\subsection{SRS Verification Plan}

\wss{List any approaches you intend to use for SRS verification.  This may
  include ad hoc feedback from reviewers, like your classmates (like your
  primary reviewer), or you may plan for something more rigorous/systematic.}

\wss{If you have a supervisor for the project, you shouldn't just say they will
read over the SRS.  You should explain your structured approach to the review.
Will you have a meeting?  What will you present?  What questions will you ask?
Will you give them instructions for a task-based inspection?  Will you use your
issue tracker?}

\wss{Maybe create an SRS checklist?}

\subsection{Design Verification Plan}

\wss{Plans for design verification}

\wss{The review will include reviews by your classmates}

\wss{Create a checklists?}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Internal Team Review
    \item Peer Review
    \item TA Review
    \item Requirements Coverage Check
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Verification and Validation Plan Verification Plan}
\label{ssub:vnv_plan_verificaiton_plan}

Once all the plans outlined in this section (\nameref{sub:plan}) are completed, they go will through a review process such that components that have no validation/verification method are discovered. The following process will take place:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Initial internal review by all group members
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Before the deadline for this document, the group will meet to look over the entire document in the search for components of the project that were overlooked in terms of testing.
        \item A checklist of all the functional and non-functional requirements from the SRS will be used to ensure each of them have a plan to be tested.
        \item All plans in this sub-sections will be checked against the grading rubric. This will act as a checklist for the expected level of detail for each plan.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Peer-Review by an external group
    \begin{itemize}
        \item As part of this deliverable another group will look over the plans from an outside perspective and give feedback on components we may have missed or were not sufficiently covered.
        \item These suggestions will be made through GitHub Issues on the repo.
    \end{itemize}
    \item TA review
    \begin{itemize}
        \item When the TA reviews this deliverable, they will provide feedback for plans that they believe could use some reconstruction.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}



\subsection{Implementation Verification Plan}

\wss{You should at least point to the tests listed in this document and the unit
  testing plan.}

\wss{In this section you would also give any details of any plans for static
  verification of the implementation.  Potential techniques include code
  walkthroughs, code inspection, static analyzers, etc.}

\wss{The final class presentation in CAS 741 could be used as a code
walkthrough.  There is also a possibility of using the final presentation (in
CAS741) for a partial usability survey.}

The primary method of validation for the implementation of the system will be the functional, non-functional, and unit tests described in this document. In addition to the static testing and code review specified in the non-functional tests, we will have a code walkthrough for each module to verify adherence to the design, and the completeness of the implementation. In these walkthroughs we will use our MIS as a checklist and go through module implementations checking off correctly implemented elements.

\subsection{Automated Testing and Verification Tools}

Refer to \href{https://github.com/russellrd/realm/blob/main/docs/DevelopmentPlan/DevelopmentPlan.pdf}{section 10 of the development plan} for the list of tools. We will use the NUnit-based Unity Testing framework for unit testing and code coverage metrics. Continuous testing will be done by GitHub actions using Unity Builder and Unity Test Runner from the GameCI open source project.

\subsection{Software Validation Plan}

\wss{If there is any external data that can be used for validation, you should
  point to it here.  If there are no plans for validation, you should state that
  here.}

\wss{You might want to use review sessions with the stakeholder to check that
the requirements document captures the right requirements.  Maybe task based
inspection?}

\wss{For those capstone teams with an external supervisor, the Rev 0 demo should 
be used as an opportunity to validate the requirements.  You should plan on 
demonstrating your project to your supervisor shortly after the scheduled Rev 0 demo.  
The feedback from your supervisor will be very useful for improving your project.}

\wss{For teams without an external supervisor, user testing can serve the same purpose 
as a Rev 0 demo for the supervisor.}

\wss{This section might reference back to the SRS verification section.}

\section{System Tests}

\wss{There should be text between all headings, even if it is just a roadmap of
the contents of the subsections.}

\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

\wss{Subsets of the tests may be in related, so this section is divided into
  different areas.  If there are no identifiable subsets for the tests, this
  level of document structure can be removed.}

\wss{Include a blurb here to explain why the subsections below
  cover the requirements.  References to the SRS would be good here.}

\subsubsection{Tutorial}

This section focuses on verifying the user interactions with the app's built-in tutorial. These tests ensure that users will have a fluid experience when finding and completing the tutorial. Given that this is the main instruction method provided by the app, it must work well otherwise users will likely stop using the app. To make it as comprehensible as possible, the tutorial has an interactive experience for every major feature as relayed in (\textit{TU-FR1}) and (\textit{TU-FR5}).  All functional requirements listed under Tutorial (TU) in the SRS \cite{SRS} have at least one test plan below.

\begin{enumerate}

    \item
    \textbf{Name:} Tutorial opens on account creation \label{itm:Test-TU1} \\
    \textbf{Test ID:} Test-TU1 \\
    \textbf{Control:} Manual \\
    \textbf{Initial State:} User has opened the app. \\
    \textbf{Input:} User creates an account. \\
    \textbf{Output:} A pop-up appears that prompts the user to take the tutorial. \\
    \textbf{Test Case Derivation:} Users who have just created an account are likely new to the app and should have some guidance on the features through the built-in tutorial. \\
    \textbf{How test will be performed:} A tester will manually create an account within the app and check if the popup appears as expected.
    
    \item
    \textbf{Name:} Tutorial can be opened through the settings screen \label{itm:Test-TU2} \\
    \textbf{Test ID:} Test-TU2 \\
    \textbf{Control:} Manual \\
    \textbf{Initial State:} User logged in. \\
    \textbf{Input:} User navigates to settings screen. \\
    \textbf{Output:} There is an option to open the tutorial. \\
    \textbf{Test Case Derivation:} Users may be having trouble with a major feature and need a refresher on how it works. They might also want to explore features they have not used yet. \\
    \textbf{How test will be performed:} A tester will manually navigate to the settings screen using the in-built navigation and look for the tutorial option.
    
    \item
    \textbf{Name:} Tutorial involves all major features \label{itm:Test-TU3} \\
    \textbf{Test ID:} Test-TU3 \\
    \textbf{Control:} Manual \\
    \textbf{Initial State:} User logged in, on tutorial screen. \\
    \textbf{Input:} User traverses through every step of the tutorial. \\
    \textbf{Output:} All major app features were seen in the tutorial. \\
    \textbf{Test Case Derivation:} Ensure that the user has been introduced to the mechanics behind every major feature. \\
    \textbf{How test will be performed:} A tester will manually go through all the tutorial steps marking off each major app feature in a checklist.
    
    \item
    \textbf{Name:} User can exit the tutorial at any time \label{itm:Test-TU4} \\
    \textbf{Test ID:} Test-TU4 \\
    \textbf{Control:} Manual \\
    \textbf{Initial State:} User logged in, on tutorial screen. \\
    \textbf{Input:} User repeatedly goes through the tutorial and attempts to exit at each unique state. \\
    \textbf{Output:} The tutorial can exit in every state. \\
    \textbf{Test Case Derivation:} A user may want to learn a subset of the major features instead of going through them all. As such, they should be able to leave the tutorial at any point instead of forcing them to complete it. \\
    \textbf{How test will be performed:} A tester will manually go through all the tutorial states and marking off which states allow a user to leave the tutorial.
    
    \item
    \textbf{Name:} The tutorial is interactive in a sandbox environment \label{itm:Test-TU5} \\
    \textbf{Test ID:} Test-TU5 \\
    \textbf{Control:} Manual \\
    \textbf{Initial State:} User logged in, on tutorial screen. \\
    \textbf{Input:} User partially attempts each step of the tutorial by interacting with the sandbox environment. \\
    \textbf{Output:} Each step of the tutorial is interactive. \\
    \textbf{Test Case Derivation:} The user experience is improved when they can directly interact with a major feature instead of the app just displaying text describing its function. \\
    \textbf{How test will be performed:} A tester will manually go through the tutorial and attempt to interact with the specific feature at each step within the sandbox environment. They don't have to complete the interaction specified in the step but it should be apparent that the major feature is working properly in the environment.

    SELECT db\_name(database\_id), encryption\_state \\
    FROM sys.dm\_database\_encryption\_keys;

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Tour Management}

This section focuses on testing the \textit{Organization User} side of the tours functionality within the app. This includes creating, modifying, and publishing tours so that \textit{General Users} can use them. The main requirement for tour management is the ability to add metadata and objects to an area (\textit{TM-FR4}) which is covered by \textit{Test-TM3} and \textit{Test-TM8}. All the other functional requirements from the Tour Management (TM) section in the SRS \cite{SRS} have at least one test plan below.

\begin{enumerate}

    \item

\subsection{Tests for Nonfunctional Requirements}

\wss{The nonfunctional requirements for accuracy will likely just reference the
  appropriate functional tests from above.  The test cases should mention
  reporting the relative error for these tests.  Not all projects will
  necessarily have nonfunctional requirements related to accuracy.}

\wss{For some nonfunctional tests, you won't be setting a target threshold for
passing the test, but rather describing the experiment you will do to measure
the quality for different inputs.  For instance, you could measure speed versus
the problem size.  The output of the test isn't pass/fail, but rather a summary
table or graph.}

\wss{Tests related to usability could include conducting a usability test and
  survey.  The survey will be in the Appendix.}

\wss{Static tests, review, inspections, and walkthroughs, will not follow the
format for the tests given below.}

\wss{If you introduce static tests in your plan, you need to provide details.
How will they be done?  In cases like code (or document) walkthroughs, who will
be involved? Be specific.}

\section{Unit Test Description}

This section will contain descriptions of the unit tests derived from the MIS, which will be completed in a later iteration of this document

\begin{comment}
\wss{This section should not be filled in until after the MIS (detailed design
  document) has been completed.}

\wss{Reference your MIS (detailed design document) and explain your overall
philosophy for test case selection.}  

\wss{To save space and time, it may be an option to provide less detail in this section.  
For the unit tests you can potentially layout your testing strategy here.  That is, you 
can explain how tests will be selected for each module.  For instance, your test building 
approach could be test cases for each access program, including one test for normal behaviour 
and as many tests as needed for edge cases.  Rather than create the details of the input 
and output here, you could point to the unit testing code.  For this to work, you code 
needs to be well-documented, with meaningful names for all of the tests.}

\subsection{Unit Testing Scope}

\wss{What modules are outside of the scope.  If there are modules that are
  developed by someone else, then you would say here if you aren't planning on
  verifying them.  There may also be modules that are part of your software, but
  have a lower priority for verification than others.  If this is the case,
  explain your rationale for the ranking of module importance.}

\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

\wss{Most of the verification will be through automated unit testing.  If
  appropriate specific modules can be verified by a non-testing based
  technique.  That can also be documented in this section.}

\subsubsection{Module 1}

\wss{Include a blurb here to explain why the subsections below cover the module.
  References to the MIS would be good.  You will want tests from a black box
  perspective and from a white box perspective.  Explain to the reader how the
  tests were selected.}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{test-id1\\}

  be automatic}

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Module 2}

\subsection{Tests for Nonfunctional Requirements}

\wss{If there is a module that needs to be independently assessed for
  performance, those test cases can go here.  In some projects, planning for
  nonfunctional tests of units will not be that relevant.}

\wss{These tests may involve collecting performance data from previously
  mentioned functional tests.}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What went well while writing this deliverable? \\
  
  Making the tests were very easy after we had the initial template down and distributed the work effectively amongst ourselves based on the functional and non-functional requirements.
  
  \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how did you resolve them?\\

    One pain point we experienced was that we had a lot to do for this deliverable that we couldn't work on the next one, which is POC. Ultimately, what we decided to do was to focus mainly on this, because the deadline is earlier, and focus mainly on getting our project set up for POC. That way, we at least have started on the next deliverable.

    Another thing was deciding which tests to automate and which to make manual. We resolved this by seeing which test would be easiest or quickest to implement. If a manual test was easiest, we would choose that, but if a manual test would take long, we'd make it automated.\\

  \item What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to successfully complete the verification and validation of your project? Examples of possible knowledge and skills include dynamic testing knowledge, static testing knowledge, specific tool usage, Valgrind etc. You should look to identify at least one item for each team member.\\

    The team will need to become familiar with C\# tooling like unit test frameworks and compatible static analysis tools. 
    
    For dynamic testing, the team will likely use the \textit{Unity Test Framework} since it is already integrated into the Unity game engine which powers the project. There are also Roslyn analyzers build for the .NET platform that are integrated into IDEs that are connected to Unity. These are useful as static analyzers that can check for errors in the code even if it still compiles.

    As a tentative plan, we will have Russell look into configuring the Roslyn analyzers that come packaged with .NET so that it meets our needs. Abdul and Avanish will research the \textit{Unity Test Framework} for the Unity \textit{Editor Mode} and \textit{Play Mode} respectively. Rafey will pick a static analysis tool like SonarQube for us to use the code.

  \item For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified in the previous question, what are at least two approaches to acquiring the knowledge or mastering the skill?  Of the identified approaches, which will each team member pursue, and why did they make this choice? \\

    One approach (especially given the popularity of Unity/.NET/SonarQube) is to watch videos online where people talk about the testing within the context of Unity projects. This could give us a prospective on how other people implement testing. Another approach is to read through the documentation associated with the topic at hand. This is very useful when a there is a smaller user base for a tool and no associated videos or examples.

    Russell will read documentation since most of his work surrounds configuration which requires a description for each configurable part. This is easily searchable when sifting through documentation.
    
    Abdul and Avanish will watch videos (if they can find some good ones) about the \textit{Unity Test Framework}. Since it is a very popular among game developers who use Unity, there should be many walkthroughs on how to use it. By watching multiple videos, they should get a sense of how people usually implement the framework for testing.

    Rafey will use google and look through internet forums to see what other developers recommend when it comes to static analysis for C\#. He will also end up looking at the documentation for these tools to decide which one works the best for our use case.
