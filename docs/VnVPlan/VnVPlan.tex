The purpose of this Verification and Validation document is to outline the testing process we'll use to make sure our project meets all its requirements and functions correctly. Verification checks that we're building the product according to our design, while validation ensures the product meets the users' needs and performs as expected. This document will describe both functional and non-functional tests, which help confirm that the project is reliable, safe, and easy to use. By following this VnV plan, we can identify and fix any issues early, ensuring the final product is high-quality and ready for users.

\section{General Information}
The section covers general information about the AR application, \textit{Realm}, and this document.

\subsection{Summary}

The software being tested is ``Realm'', an AR touring platform. The platform allows users to place AR objects in the real world for others to see and allows organizations to create AR tours to provide users with high-quality experiences. This document will include tests for all requirements as well as the design plan for validation and verification.

\subsection{Objectives}

The primary objectives for the validation and verification of Realm are as follows: \\

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Ensure accuracy of AR functionality}: One of our core goals is to build confidence in the AR features' correctness, confirming that the AR objects can be placed effectively. We also want to ensure that overlays align accurately with real-world elements, and behave as intended in various lighting and spatial conditions. \\

  \item \textbf{Verify usability and engagement}: Usability testing will focus on confirming that users can seamlessly navigate through the app, and interact with AR objects and other users. This includes ease of use, intuitiveness of the AR controls, and overall satisfaction with the social sharing features. \\

  \item \textbf{Data security and privacy assurance}: Given the app's AR elements, it's essential to ensure that all user data, including images and interaction history, is securely managed and protected from unauthorized access. \\
\end{itemize}

Due to limited resources, the following objectives will not be prioritized in this phase: \\

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Universal device compatibility}: Testing will focus on popular AR-enabled devices, but comprehensive performance validation across all devices and OS versions is outside the scope of this initial release. \\

  \item \textbf{Verification of third-party libraries}: The project relies on AR libraries and frameworks from external providers. We assume these libraries have been validated by their developers, allowing us to concentrate on verifying custom AR functionality and app-specific features. \\
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Challenge Level and Extras}

The challenge level for the Realm project is \textbf{general}. The extras that are going to be tackled in this project are \textbf{user documentation} and \textbf{usability testing}. We chose these two as they are deemed useful to the user's interaction with our app. The user documentation will help the user to learn to use the app simply, and the usability testing will help us to deliver a product that is acceptable and tailored to the use case of our users.

  \caption{Verification and Validation Testing Team Roles and Responsibilities}
\end{table}

\subsection{SRS Verification Plan}

For the SRS Verification Plan, we will adopt a structured approach that includes peer reviews, systematic checks, and feedback from our TA. Initially, ad hoc feedback will be gathered from team members to identify any immediate issues or ambiguities in the SRS. We will then conduct a detailed review session where each team member inspects specific sections of the document using a predefined checklist focused on clarity, completeness, and alignment with project goals. We will also meet with our TA to discuss and gather further feedback. An issue tracker will be used to document all feedback, allowing us to systematically address and resolve identified issues.

\subsection{Design Verification Plan}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Internal Team Review
  \item Peer Review
  \item TA Review
  \item Requirements Coverage Check
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Verification and Validation Plan Verification Plan}
\label{ssub:vnv_plan_verificaiton_plan}

Once all the plans outlined in this section (\nameref{sub:plan}) are completed, they go will through a review process such that components that have no validation/verification method are discovered. The following process will take place:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Initial internal review by all group members
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Before the deadline for this document, the group will meet to look over the entire document in the search for components of the project that were overlooked in terms of testing.
          \item A checklist of all the functional and non-functional requirements from the SRS will be used to ensure each of them have a plan to be tested.
          \item All plans in this sub-sections will be checked against the grading rubric. This will act as a checklist for the expected level of detail for each plan.
        \end{itemize}
  \item Peer-Review by an external group
        \begin{itemize}
          \item As part of this deliverable another group will look over the plans from an outside perspective and give feedback on components we may have missed or were not sufficiently covered.
          \item These suggestions will be made through GitHub Issues on the repo.
        \end{itemize}
  \item TA review
        \begin{itemize}
          \item When the TA reviews this deliverable, they will provide feedback for plans that they believe could use some reconstruction.
        \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}



\subsection{Implementation Verification Plan}

The primary method of validation for the implementation of the system will be the functional, non-functional, and unit tests described in this document. In addition to the static testing and code review specified in the non-functional tests, we will have a code walkthrough for each module to verify adherence to the design, and the completeness of the implementation. In these walkthroughs we will use our MIS as a checklist and go through module implementations checking off correctly implemented elements.

\subsection{Automated Testing and Verification Tools}

Refer to \href{https://github.com/russellrd/realm/blob/main/docs/DevelopmentPlan/DevelopmentPlan.pdf}{section 10 of the development plan} for the list of tools. We will use the NUnit-based Unity Testing framework for unit testing and code coverage metrics. Continuous testing will be done by GitHub actions using Unity Builder and Unity Test Runner from the GameCI open source project.

\subsection{Software Validation Plan}

To validate the software throughout development, we will hold bi-weekly developer meetings. In each meeting, members will present their additions to the codebase and explain how these changes impact the functionality of the targeted components. Each team member will provide a walkthrough of the modified component through a live demo. During these meetings, the team will also ensure that no functional requirements have been inadvertently removed. \\

To further validate that all components function as intended, we will use formal methods, which include a suite of test cases, user testing, and surveys. \\

The suite of test cases will consist of \textit{unit tests}, \textit{module tests}, and \textit{system tests}, designed to verify that each component and the overall system meet functionality requirements. \\

User testing will be conducted by individuals outside the development team, and results will be evaluated using checklists based on the functional and non-functional requirements outlined in the Software Requirements Specification (SRS). \\

Finally, surveys will be administered to test users, allowing them to provide feedback on user experience and satisfaction with the software's functionality. \\

\section{System Tests}
This section contains the descriptions of all system tests spanning functional and non-functional aspects of the application.

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the
graduate attribute of Lifelong Learning.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What went well while writing this deliverable? \\

        Making the tests were very easy after we had the initial template down and distributed the work effectively amongst ourselves based on the functional and non-functional requirements.

  \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how did you resolve them?\\

        One pain point we experienced was that we had a lot to do for this deliverable that we couldn't work on the next one, which is POC. Ultimately, what we decided to do was to focus mainly on this, because the deadline is earlier, and focus mainly on getting our project set up for POC. That way, we at least have started on the next deliverable.

        Another thing was deciding which tests to automate and which to make manual. We resolved this by seeing which test would be easiest or quickest to implement. If a manual test was easiest, we would choose that, but if a manual test would take long, we'd make it automated.\\

  \item What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to successfully complete the verification and validation of your project? Examples of possible knowledge and skills include dynamic testing knowledge, static testing knowledge, specific tool usage, Valgrind etc. You should look to identify at least one item for each team member.\\

        The team will need to become familiar with C\# tooling like unit test frameworks and compatible static analysis tools.

        For dynamic testing, the team will likely use the \textit{Unity Test Framework} since it is already integrated into the Unity game engine which powers the project. There are also Roslyn analyzers build for the .NET platform that are integrated into IDEs that are connected to Unity. These are useful as static analyzers that can check for errors in the code even if it still compiles.

        As a tentative plan, we will have Russell look into configuring the Roslyn analyzers that come packaged with .NET so that it meets our needs. Abdul and Avanish will research the \textit{Unity Test Framework} for the Unity \textit{Editor Mode} and \textit{Play Mode} respectively. Rafey will pick a static analysis tool like SonarQube for us to use the code.

  \item For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified in the previous question, what are at least two approaches to acquiring the knowledge or mastering the skill?  Of the identified approaches, which will each team member pursue, and why did they make this choice? \\

        One approach (especially given the popularity of Unity/.NET/SonarQube) is to watch videos online where people talk about the testing within the context of Unity projects. This could give us a prospective on how other people implement testing. Another approach is to read through the documentation associated with the topic at hand. This is very useful when a there is a smaller user base for a tool and no associated videos or examples.

        Russell will read documentation since most of his work surrounds configuration which requires a description for each configurable part. This is easily searchable when sifting through documentation.

        Abdul and Avanish will watch videos (if they can find some good ones) about the \textit{Unity Test Framework}. Since it is a very popular among game developers who use Unity, there should be many walkthroughs on how to use it. By watching multiple videos, they should get a sense of how people usually implement the framework for testing.

        Rafey will use Google and look through internet forums to see what other developers recommend when it comes to static analysis for C\#. He will also end up looking at the documentation for these tools to decide which one works the best for our use case.
