Date of project start: Sept 12, 2024

The goal of the project is to create an AR platform that facilitates social, educational, and entertaining experiences through one cohesive user experience. Social experiences are facilitated by allowing users to place AR objects in the real world for others to see. Users will be able to have friends on the platform, and engage in the unique social interactions made possible by the platform both privately with friends, and publicly. Educational experiences will be provided by businesses on our platform through AR tours. Users can participate in these tours and provide both text and visual enhancement to any setting, whether it be a national park or a historic site. Entertaining experiences will be provided by on demand AR projection in any space that will allow users to see what interesting things from around the world might look like up close.
